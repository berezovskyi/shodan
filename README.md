# shodan

An [event-sourcing-based](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) RDF datastore and processor.

## Usage

Let's create a new RDF datastore first:

	$ python shodan.py -i ex1

You can check if this has worked out: go to your home directory where you should find a new directory named with the store name, `ex1` in our case.
